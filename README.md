#  Phantom Components Demo
This repo is meant as a demonstration of the components created in [Phantom Components](https://github.com/PhantomVRTranslate/Phantom_Components).  This repo is also used in the npx package [project-phantom/create](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@project-phantom/create).

### Component Demo
This repo is used as a component demonstration to show what the custom components look like live.  An up-to-date list of these components can be found on the Phantom Components repo.
### NPX package
In order to facilitate the creation of new VR websites we have set up an npx package to construct the basic architecture of a site.  This can be performed using the running the following command in the command line:
``` 
npx @project-phantom/create 
```
This command will download the repository, reinitialize git with and initial commit, and start running the server.
